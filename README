############################## Halite III - Team WeGotThis ####################

We elaborated more strategies in order to collect efficiently halite from the map,
depending on the map's resources, map's size or the opponent's behaviour.

Project structure:
-- maximum halite collecting from the map, by cretaing drop-offs on the zone 
with the most halite, but only after spawning 9 ships and collecting at least
5001 halite.

-- at the end of the game, we choose to get the ships to the shipyard, because
it seems that it's no worth in collecting any more halite.
Depending on the game map sizes we go to the shipyard at round 350 (32x32) / 
round 360 (40x40 or 48x48) / round 430 (56x56).

-- we choose to spawn no more than 15 ships.

-- we choose to get the ships to the shipyard / dropOff when they collect at certain
percent of halite, depending on the round or map type (0.9 collecting at first, 
then 0.6 at the end for 32x32 & 56x56or 0.4 for 40x40 & 48x48), 
using method "goToDepo".
